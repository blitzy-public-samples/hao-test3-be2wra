# Security Policy

This document outlines the security procedures and policies for the Hello World web application.

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Currently supported versions are:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within the Hello World web application, please follow these steps:

1. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly.
2. Email your findings to security@example.com. Encrypt your findings using our PGP key to prevent this critical information from falling into the wrong hands.
3. Provide sufficient information to reproduce the vulnerability, so we can resolve it quickly.
4. We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and strive to send you regular updates about our progress.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for all still-supported versions of the Hello World web application.
4. Release new versions and patches.
5. Publish a security advisory on our website and notify users.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss.

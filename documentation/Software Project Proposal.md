### BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

1. Scope Creep: 
   - Risk: Client requests additional features or changes beyond the initial requirements.
   - Mitigation: Clearly define project scope in the contract. Any changes will be subject to change orders and additional costs.

2. Browser Compatibility Issues:
   - Risk: Unexpected compatibility issues with certain browsers may require additional development time.
   - Mitigation: The contingency budget can cover minor adjustments. Major issues may require a change order.

3. Client Delays:
   - Risk: Delayed feedback or approvals from the client could extend the project timeline.
   - Mitigation: Include a clause in the contract specifying that delays caused by the client may result in additional charges.

4. Technology Changes:
   - Risk: Rapid changes in web technologies could affect development or compatibility.
   - Mitigation: The project uses standard, stable web technologies, minimizing this risk.

5. Testing Complexity:
   - Risk: More extensive testing required due to diverse user devices and browsers.
   - Mitigation: The testing budget includes a buffer for additional time if needed.

```mermaid
pie title Budget Allocation
    "Project Management" : 400
    "UI/UX Design" : 180
    "Front-end Development" : 480
    "Testing and QA" : 210
    "Deployment Support" : 80
    "Contingency" : 135
```

This budget is based on the current project scope and requirements. Any significant changes or additions to the project scope may require a reassessment of the budget and timeline. The contingency fund is included to handle minor unexpected issues or small scope adjustments without requiring immediate budget revisions.

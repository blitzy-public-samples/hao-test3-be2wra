## DATA REQUIREMENTS

Given the simplicity of the "Hello World" web application, which is entirely client-side and does not involve server-side data storage or processing, the data requirements are minimal. However, we will outline the relevant aspects to maintain consistency with the document structure and provide a foundation for potential future enhancements.

### DATA MODELS

The application does not require a complex data model as it only deals with displaying a static message and the current date. However, for clarity, we can represent the basic structure of the data displayed on the page:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    PAGE ||--|{ ELEMENT : contains
    ELEMENT {
        string type
        string content
    }
    PAGE {
        string title
    }
```

In this simple model:
- The PAGE represents the single web page of the application.
- ELEMENT represents the individual components on the page (Hello World message, current date, and refresh button).
- Each ELEMENT has a type (e.g., "message", "date", "button") and content.

### DATA STORAGE

As this is a client-side only application, there is no persistent data storage on the server. However, we can consider the following aspects:

1. Local Storage:
   - The application may use browser local storage to cache the last known date in case of offline usage.
   - Retention: Until the user clears their browser data or the application explicitly removes it.

2. Redundancy:
   - Not applicable for server-side storage as there is none.

3. Backup:
   - Not applicable for server-side data.

4. Recovery:
   - In case of local storage failure, the application will simply recalculate the current date using the device's system time.

### DATA PROCESSING

The data processing in this application is minimal and occurs entirely on the client-side. Here's an overview of the data flow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User's Device] -->|System Time| B[JavaScript Date Object]
    B -->|Format Date| C[Display Current Date]
    D[User Interaction] -->|Click Refresh Button| B
```

Data Security:
1. Input Validation:
   - Ensure that the "Refresh" button click event is properly handled to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities.

2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:
   - Use proper encoding when displaying the date to prevent any potential XSS attacks, even though the date is generated client-side.

3. Content Security Policy:
   - Implement a strict Content Security Policy to prevent unauthorized script execution and resource loading.

4. HTTPS:
   - Serve the application over HTTPS to ensure data integrity during transit, even though no sensitive data is being transmitted.

5. Data Minimization:
   - The application only processes the necessary data (current date) to fulfill its function, adhering to data minimization principles.

6. Client-Side Security:
   - Implement measures to prevent tampering with the client-side JavaScript that generates and displays the date.

Given the nature of this simple, client-side application, the data requirements are straightforward. The application does not store or process any user data, focusing solely on displaying the current date based on the user's device time. This approach ensures minimal data handling, reducing potential security and privacy concerns while still meeting the core requirements of the "Hello World" web application.

## EXTERNAL INTERFACES
